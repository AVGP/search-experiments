<h1>Link discovery</h1>
<p>Googlebot generally discovers links by looking through the HTML contents of a crawled page.</p>
<p>It does so, including HTML parts that are generated by JavaScript, which means that the rendered HTML is used.</p>
<p>That rendered HTML is the output of the Web Rendering Service (WRS).</p>
<h2>Questions</h2>
<p>So link, such as <a href="/features">this one to the Feature Detection page</a> will be discovered, but what about links that are hidden in comment nodes in the HTML?</p>
<p>Let's find out!</p>
<!--

<p>Let's pad the link with some DOM</p>
<p><a href="/web-components">This link goes to the web components test</a></p>
<p>Hmm, we'll see...</p>
-->

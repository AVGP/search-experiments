  <h1>Redirects and Googlebot</h1>
  <p>Googlebot supports redirects and so do the testing tools. There are many ways of doing redirects. Let's look at a few of them!</p>
  
  <h2>Server redirects</h2>
  <p>
    One of the first things Googlebot does is making an HTTP request to your server.
    If your server responds with a redirect (HTTP code 301 or 302) and a new target URL, 
    Googlebot will receive this response and issue a new request to the URL that was in the response.
  </p>
  
  <h2>JavaScript redirects</h2>
  <p>
    Alternatively, your server can respond with some HTML that contains JavaScript.
    The JavaScript can then use <code>window.location.href</code> to initiate a redirection.
